Kadane's Algorithm is an alternative to the Sliding Window technique
when the given array contains negative values. In this case, the sliding window 
technique wouldn't exactly work!

Idea:

Look at each index I
-> ask yourself, what is the maximum sum ending at this index I?

at Index I, we ask:
- would the sum be higher if I add the current value to the runningSum or would the
value alone (start from scratch) be higher?
- then choose [prevSubarry,currentVal] or currentVal
