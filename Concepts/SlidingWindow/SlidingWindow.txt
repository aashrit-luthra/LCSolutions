Sliding Window is a very powerful algorithmic technique!

What is a Sliding Window?

You have a large area (ie. array), and you have a window within it (in a subset), and you then 
ask questions!

If the window is fixed size => Static Sliding Window
If the window is dynamically changing size => Dynamic Sliding Window

Benefits:

More efficient approach than brute force algorithm which usually does repeated work a lot.
(ie. Brings O(n * k) ~ O(n^2) to O(n))

Example Problems:

Find Maximum Sum of a Contiguous Subarray of Size K (3)
-> Fixed Size (of 3)
-> Want to find Maximum Sum

Brute Force way would bo:
- loop from 0 to n - 3
- inside each loop, loop through the next three elements
- compute the Sum
- check if it is Maximum
- NOTE: checking the sum of an element would be done three times (can make more efficient using Sliding Window!)

Sliding Window Approach:
- Keep track of a running sum
- keep a global sum, and update if needed with running sum

How to Spot Sliding Window??

* CONTIGUOUS sequence of elements / Subarray (grouped sequentially)
* Can be done on strings, arrays, even linked lists
* Asks something from: min, max, longest, shortest, contained, running average

Types:
1. Fixed Length
2. Dynamic Length
-> ex: Window with smallest sum >= to some value S
3. Dynamic Length w/ Auxiliary Data Structure
-> ex: longest substring w/ no more than k distinct characters
4. String Permutations
