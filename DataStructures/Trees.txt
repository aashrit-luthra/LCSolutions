Binary Trees (Trees, in general) are much different than arrays and linked lists
- as in, they are not linear
- non-linear data structures

Subtrees of a node are also Trees (so you can call the same action on them)
- their subtrees are also Trees
- therefore, recursive!

- do a recursive function, until you reach a base case

Four Steps:
- finding one or more base cases
- calling the same function on the left subtrees
- calling the same function on the right subtrees
- joining the results

Traverse Through Trees in two ways:
- DFS
- BFS

def dfs(root, path):
if root is None:
    return
else:
    print(root.val)
    path.append(root)
    dfs(root.left)
    dfs(root.right)
    path.pop()
