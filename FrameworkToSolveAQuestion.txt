There are THREE stages to solving a Coding Interview Problem!

1. BEFORE Coding

a. Read and Understand
-> Read and understand the question
-> List the input, output, and process

b. Clarify
-> Ask clarifying questions of the input or output type if needed
-> Ask clarifying questions on the process if not totally clear
-> Ask how edge cases should be dealt with 

c. Describe
-> Explain the question to yourself again, with the heightened knowledge you now have

2. WHILE Coding

a. Brainstorm
-> Brainstorm possible solutions of how to solve the Problem
-> Evaluate time complexity and space complexity of these different approaches
-> Use examples if needed, and solve the 'human' way to come up with an algorithm
-> Write algorithm in plain english to have as an outline

b. Write
-> Talk and think out loud while you are writing code
-> Make sure each line is doing what is intended
-> Ensure you are writing clean and modularized code

c. Test
-> Take an example, and run through the algorithm with the test case

3. AFTER Coding

a. Review & Reflect
-> State time and space complexity

b. Discuss Improvements
-> If needed, state how the code can be improved
